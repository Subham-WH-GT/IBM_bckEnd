DataBase is classified into two types--

* Relational dataBase

*Non-Relational dataBase

In relational dataBase datas are mainly stored in the form of relations
or tables. Hence datas are stored in a structured manner. Ex: oracle,mySQL

whereas, in non-relational dataBase, datas are stored in various data-models
like Key-Value,document,columnar or graph format . . . 
ex: MongoDB(document type), Neo4j(graph database), Redis(key-value pair)
Non-relational databases are more flexible tha relational database.
