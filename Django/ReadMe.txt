Django is a high-level, heavy python web-framework. 

It integrates use of objects to make databases.

user dont need to remember SQL queries to create tables and manage
database, rather they can integrate the use of python objects to
craete data-bases.

ORM(Object relation Mapping) tachnology is used to handle python
objects to use as database.

here, each model class behaves as entity/table...attributes behaves as
columns and objects behave as Rows...
